# Nixus

## About

This repo contains my reorganized and rewritten NixOS configuration.
It might not be widely considered _correct_ or whatever, because I used some of my braincells to come up with this autistic design philosophy:

- nixpkgs as the only input, just straight up rawdogging nix
- wrap binaries instead of putting files in home dir
- do not copy from others
- try to avoid `with` keyword as much as possible

## But why?

Idk, but I like it, probably IKEA effect. Also my config probably moggs yours in terms of evaluation times. Clean install in under 10 minutes. 

## Contents

- **NixOS hosts** - currently only my twinkpad x1
- **NixOS modules** - including $HOME management, impermanence and some laptop specific things
- **Dev shell** - shell containing my entire terminal workflow, with fully configured neovim and stuff. 
- **Packages** - Mostly unmodified packages from nixpkgs, wrapped with my configs, themed via base16 attribute set
- **Theme** - which outputs my current base16 theme as an attrset 

# Why I don't use some of the popular NixOS modules?

## Home-manager

I don't like it. I prefer to wrap my binaries. Much better solution.

Everyone in nix community will tell you that hm is a mess.

## Flake-parts

Actually I have nothing against using flake-parts, although I don't see the use case in my NixOS configuration since I only use one cpu architecture.

Trust me, I tried. It never compiles on ARM anyway

## Impermanence

I found it needlessly overcomplicated and unreliable.

## Nix-colors

It's just a glorified attribute set
